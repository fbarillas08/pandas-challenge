There are various observations that are worthy of noting.  However, there are two salient observations to be made based on
the following two factors:
- School Size
- Type of School

There is a significant gap in performance based on the size of the school in Mathematics, Reading, and as both subjects
taken together.  Small schools (Less than 1000 students) out perform Medium (up to 3000 students) and Large (Over 3000 students)
in all metrics: average scores and percentage of students passing the tests.

The Type of School (Charter vs District) seemed to also influence the performance of the students albeit not as dramatical as
the previous observation.  Nevertheless, although the average scores in Math and Reading do not seem to be too far away from
each other, significant differences in the % of students above the passing mark in Math and in the Overall Score occur.

A third observation that has a surprising negative correlation is the level of investment per student (Budget per Student) against
academic performance in Math, Reading, and their Aggreate.  The higher the investment made per student, the lower is the performance.
This is something that requires further analysis because it is counterintuitive.

Additional analyses would include identifying sensitivity of results against the gender.
